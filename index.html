        Know the Signs, Help Save a Life: Sudden Cardiac Arrest vs. Heart Attack

      <h2>
        While a heart attack and sudden cardiac arrest are both serious medical
        emergencies, they are distinct conditions that require different action.
      </h2>
      <p class="vip">
        When someone has a sudden cardiac event, the ability of those nearby to
        identify and act accordingly can be the determining factor in whether
        that person survives.!
      </p>

      <h2>Here’s what you should know:</h2>
      <p>
        In cardiac arrest, the event will be sudden—the person’s heart will stop
        and you will not be able to detect a pulse. They will also become faint
        unconscious and stop breathing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cardiac arrest is caused by an issue in the heart's electrical system
        and may not be a detectable condition leading up to the event.
        Hands-only CPR can significantly improve chance of survival in cardiac
        arrest cases. Use of an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) gives
        someone in cardiac arrest the best chance of survival while they wait
        for medical professionals to arrive on the scene.
      </p>

      <h2>CPR</h2>
      <p>
        If someone is unconscious and not breathing normally, call 999 and start
        CPR straight away.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you call 999 for an ambulance, you should be given basic
        life-saving instructions over the phone, including advice about CPR.
      </p>
      <h2>CPR on adults</h2>
      <p class="vip">
        If you have been trained in CPR, including rescue breaths, and feel
        confident using your skills, you should give chest compressions with
        rescue breaths. If you're not completely confident, attempt hands-only
        CPR instead.
      </p>
      <h2>Hands-only CPR</h2>

      <p>To carry out a chest compression:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Kneel next to the person and place the heel of your hand on the
          breastbone at the centre of their chest. Place the palm of your other
          hand on top of the hand that's on their chest and interlock your
          fingers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Position yourself so your shoulders are directly above your hands.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using your body weight (not just your arms), press straight down by 5
          to 6cm (2 to 2.5 inches) on their chest.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keeping your hands on their chest, release the compression and allow
          their chest to return to its original position.
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeat these compressions at a rate of 100 to 120 times a minute until
          an ambulance arrives or for as long as you can.
        </li>
      </ol>
